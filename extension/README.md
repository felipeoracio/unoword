# Word Count — Chrome Extension (Phase 2)

> **Editor support & limitations (word counting).** Counting is driven by
> `input` events + `inputType`, reconciled against the editor's actual text
> (see `shared/wordcount.js`). This works in `<textarea>`, text `<input>`, and
> **contenteditable rich editors like Notion** (bold/italic/blocks are invisible
> to the whitespace tokenizer, so formatting never changes the count). Cut
> (`deleteByCut`), Undo (`historyUndo`) and Redo (`historyRedo`) all resync.
> **Google Docs is not supported for word counting**: it renders text on a
> `<canvas>` with a hidden off-DOM input, so its editable content is not exposed
> to content scripts and cannot be read reliably. Manual/automated coverage:
> `tests/engine.test.js` (unit), `tests/preview.html` (textarea) and
> `tests/preview-rich.html` (contenteditable / Notion-style).

A minimal, private Chrome extension that tracks your writing sessions.
Free users get a live word counter, on-screen floating pill, and local
session history. Pro users add a **daily writing prompt**, a
**words-per-session goal**, a full **progress dashboard**, and
**English / Spanish** localization — all still stored locally on the
device.

> Phase 2 — Paid features (goals · prompts · dashboard · i18n). Payment
> is a **demo toggle**: "Try Pro" flips the switch locally. Nothing is
> billed. Wire Stripe later without changing the UI.

## Features

**Free** (works out of the box)

- **One-click session** — Start / Stop with a single button.
- **On-screen floating counter** — Draggable pill shows `● N words` on
  every supported page. Click for Stop button.
- **Session history** — Local log of your last 500 completed sessions,
  grouped by day.
- **Auto light/dark**, keyboard accessible, private (nothing leaves
  your device).

**Pro** (demo toggle — click Upgrade → Try Pro)

- **Session word goal** — Any positive integer, must be a multiple of
  25. Inline validation suggests the closest valid neighbours.
- **Goal on the floating counter** — `● 127 / 250 words`, with the dot
  turning blue when the goal is reached.
- **Daily writing prompt** — Curated static library across ~29 themes,
  one prompt per day (with an "Another prompt" escape hatch). Prompt
  history prevents immediate repetition.
- **Full-page dashboard** — Today / This week / This month / This year
  / All time. Hero total, chart, avg per day, best day, longest
  session, recent sessions list.
- **English / Spanish** — Auto-detected from the browser on first run,
  fully switchable in Settings, applied everywhere including the
  floating counter and prompts.
- **Optional AI context draft** — The existing Pro onboarding includes a
  fifth, optional step for writing goals, audience, current projects and
  topics to avoid. The draft stays in `chrome.storage.local` with
  `syncStatus: "local_only"`; no network request or model training occurs.
- **Supabase account bridge** — Settings now supports email/password sign-in
  through the UnoWord backend. Session tokens stay in secure httpOnly cookies,
  never `chrome.storage`. AI controls remain hidden until the backend confirms
  both authentication and an active AI entitlement. The first profile sync
  requires confirmation; later profile edits auto-sync and writing sessions
  remain local unless the user separately chooses to save them.
- **Consent-based AI Memory** — After Stop, users can choose Save, Don't Save,
  or confirm Always Save. UnoWord reads only the active editor at that event;
  normal keystroke counting still sends word deltas, never writing text. Saved
  writing is AES-GCM encrypted with a non-extractable device key in IndexedDB
  and queued as ciphertext (maximum 100 sessions, no expiry). Pre-login items
  require an explicit account claim. Synced encrypted copies remain deletable
  from AI Settings and retries are idempotent by session reference.
- **Private document context** — Signed-in AI users can upload TXT, Markdown,
  text-layer PDF, and DOCX files up to 5 MB from AI Settings. The backend
  validates the actual format, rejects unsafe/oversized archives and scanned
  PDFs without a text layer, stores the original in private Supabase Storage,
  and creates bounded retrieval chunks. Delete removes the Storage object,
  metadata, chunks, and any future cascading embeddings together.
- **Discover → Develop → Connect** — Eligible AI accounts can select New Topic,
  Expand an Idea, or Connect the Dots, then Generate Suggestion. Opening the
  popup does not spend AI allowance. Expand accepts an explicitly loaded tab
  draft, a pasted idea, or previous material. Each result includes three
  questions and checked source credits. Try Another keeps the chosen mode;
  Save Idea adds private unfinished-idea memory, and Start Writing starts the
  existing word-counting session with that idea. Saved ideas reopen in the
  popup. Existing server entitlements and daily limits apply to every mode.

```

Both the popup and the on-screen floating counter read from the **same
`chrome.storage.local` state**, so a Stop from either surface updates the
other immediately. There is one source of truth: `wc_state`.

### Session lifecycle

1. User clicks **Start Session** in the popup.
2. Background creates a new session, resets `typedText` / `pastedText`
   buffers, timestamps `startedAt`, and stores state in
   `chrome.storage.local`.
3. Content scripts on every allowed page cache `sessionActive = true` (via
   `chrome.storage.onChanged`) and start reporting `input`-event deltas to
   the background.
4. Background updates buffers and rebroadcasts state — the popup renders
   live counts if it happens to be open.
5. User clicks **Stop Session**. Background timestamps `endedAt`, snapshots
   the final counts into `lastResult`, flips `active` to `false`. The next
   time the popup opens it shows the "Session complete" result.

### Delta classification

Content script inspects `InputEvent.inputType` on the `input` event:

| inputType                                      | Reported as |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `insertText`, `insertLineBreak`, `insertParagraph`, `insertCompositionText*` | `typed`     |
| `insertFromPaste`, `insertFromDrop`, `insertReplacementText`, `insertFromPasteAsQuotation` | `pasted`    |
| any `delete*`                                  | `deleted`   |

For safety, the script also computes `curr.length - prev.length` to know
exactly how many characters were added or removed, so counts stay accurate
even when `event.data` is empty (line breaks, IME composition, etc).

### Word count

Words are computed by collapsing whitespace and splitting on spaces:

```js
text.replace(/\s+/g, ' ').trim().split(' ').length
```

This yields intuitive results: `"state-of-the-art"` is 1 word,
`"don't stop"` is 2, `"1200 words"` is 2. Multiple spaces, tabs, and line
breaks all collapse to a single word boundary.

Nothing is a "kitchen-sink" file: each module has one clear job. The word
counter is a pure function, easy to reuse in future phases.

---

## The floating on-screen counter

While a session is active, `content.js` injects a small overlay into every
supported page:

```
● 1,247 words  ⋮⋮
```

- **Isolated** — Rendered inside a Shadow DOM so no host-page CSS can leak
  in and it can never affect the page's layout. Uses `position: fixed`
  with a `z-index` at the top of the stacking context. It does **not**
  push page content, resize text fields, or interfere with scroll,
  selection, copy/paste, or typing.
- **Draggable** — Click and drag anywhere on the pill to move it. The
  position is stored in `chrome.storage.local` under
  `wc_settings.counterPos` and restored on every page.
- **Click to expand** — A single click reveals a **Stop Session** button.
  Click again (or press Escape) to collapse.
- **Auto light/dark** — Follows `prefers-color-scheme`, matching the popup.
- **Only when active** — Mounts on session start, unmounts immediately on
  stop. Never appears on Chrome-restricted pages (`chrome://…`, Web
  Store), which simply lose the overlay until the user returns to a
  supported page.
- **Cross-tab sync** — All tabs see the same session because they all read
  from the same `chrome.storage.local` and listen to `storage.onChanged`.
- **Accessible** — `role="button"`, keyboard-focusable, Enter/Space
  toggles expand, Escape collapses, sufficient contrast in both themes.

### Sizing / responsiveness

Default position is bottom-right with 20px viewport padding. Padding and
type-size compress slightly on viewports narrower than 480px. If the
window is resized so the counter would fall off-screen, it snaps back
inside the viewport.

---

## Word-counting rules

The counter is intentionally simple and predictable:

- Whitespace (space, tab, newline, multiple spaces) → word boundaries.
- Punctuation stays attached to its word.
  - `"hello!"` = 1 word.
- Hyphens and apostrophes do **not** split words.
  - `"state-of-the-art"` = 1 word · `"don't"` = 1 word.
- Numbers count as words: `"1,247"` (rendered) or `"1200"` (typed) = 1 word.
- Deletions decrement the count where technically possible (see
  [Known limitations](#known-limitations)).
- Line breaks (Enter / Shift+Enter) are word boundaries but don't inflate
  the count.

Full behavior is validated in `tests/engine.test.js`.

---

## Privacy

- The extension **never sends your writing anywhere**.
- No network requests are made from `background.js` or `content.js`.
- Storage is `chrome.storage.local` only.
- The typed/pasted text buffers stored during an active session are only
  kept to compute the word count accurately across deletions. They are
  cleared at the start of the next session.
- No analytics, no telemetry.

---

## Permissions

Only one Chrome permission is requested:

- **`storage`** — to persist session state locally so the popup can close and
  reopen without losing your count.

The extension uses `content_scripts` with `<all_urls>` so it can observe
`input` events on the page you're writing on. It does **not** request
`tabs`, `history`, `bookmarks`, or `activeTab`. It never reads the
existing content of a page — only responds to `input` events that fire
while a session is active.

---

## Known limitations

- **Deletions across sources** — When you delete characters, we can't
  always know whether they were originally typed or pasted. The extension
  removes from the typed buffer first, then the pasted buffer. This is a
  best-effort approximation.
- **Chrome-restricted pages** — Content scripts cannot run on
  `chrome://`, the Chrome Web Store, or the New Tab Page. Typing there
  won't be counted. The extension fails silently on these pages; no error
  is shown because no script runs.
- **Cross-origin iframes** — By design (`all_frames: false`) the script
  only runs in the top frame. Text inputs inside iframes (e.g. some
  embedded editors) are not counted yet.
- **Rich editors with custom key handling** — Some editors (e.g.
  CodeMirror, Monaco) don't dispatch standard `InputEvent`s; behavior may
  vary. Tested reliable on plain `<textarea>`, `<input type="text">`,
  and standard `contenteditable`.
- **IME composition** — Composed characters are counted when the
  composition is committed. Individual composition intermediates are
  ignored to avoid double-counting.
- **Undo / redo** — Undo is treated as a series of deletions/insertions
  by the browser and handled the same way as manual editing. If a page
  performs a custom undo without firing `input` events, changes won't be
  reflected.

## Manual test checklist

Suggested run-through before shipping any change:

**Basic**

- [ ] Load unpacked. Icon shows in toolbar.
- [ ] First open of popup shows onboarding with two choices.
- [ ] Pick "Keep separate" — session panel appears in idle state.
- [ ] Click **Start Session** — button flips to red "Stop Session", pill
      turns green with "Writing Session", duration begins ticking.
- [ ] Type a sentence in a textarea on any page (e.g. Google, GitHub
      issue box, Gmail compose). Reopen popup — count reflects what you
      typed.
- [ ] Paste a sentence — the small line "+ N pasted" appears.
- [ ] Delete a word — count decreases.
- [ ] Click **Stop Session** — pill flips to "Session complete", final
      count and duration are shown, button becomes **Start New Session**.

**On-screen floating counter**

- [ ] After **Start Session**, a small `● N words` pill appears in the
      bottom-right of the page.
- [ ] Number updates as you type.
- [ ] Click the pill — a **Stop Session** button appears below the count.
- [ ] Click the pill again (or press Escape) — the button collapses.
- [ ] Drag the pill anywhere on the page — it stays where you dropped it.
- [ ] Navigate to another supported page — the pill re-appears in the
      same position you dragged it to.
- [ ] Click the pill's **Stop Session** — the pill disappears everywhere
      and the popup shows "Session complete".
- [ ] Alternatively, click **Stop Session** in the popup — the on-screen
      pill disappears immediately.

**Persistence**

- [ ] Close the popup mid-session, keep typing, reopen — count is up to
      date.
- [ ] Navigate to another page mid-session — session stays active.
- [ ] Reload the tab mid-session — session stays active, pill reappears.

**Settings**

- [ ] Click the gear icon. Change to "Count pasted as typed" — big
      number in popup and pill both switch to combined total.

**Pro (demo)**

- [ ] Click the extension icon → **Upgrade** → **Try Pro** →
      walk through the 4-step onboarding (Language → Goal → Themes → Done).
- [ ] The popup shows a PRO badge, a Dashboard icon, a **Today's writing
      prompt** card, and a `X / 250 words` pill in the session.
- [ ] Enter `260` in Settings → Writing goal → shows red error
      "Please enter a goal in increments of 25 words. Try 250 or 275 words."
- [ ] Save `500` — the pill on the floating counter updates to
      `● N / 500 words` next session.
- [ ] Reach the goal — the dot turns blue and the pill reads
      **Goal reached** (popup) / stays counting past 500 (never stops).
- [ ] Click **Another prompt** — a different prompt appears and stays
      through the day.
- [ ] Change language to Español in Settings — everything (popup,
      prompt, floating counter, dashboard) switches immediately.
- [ ] Open the Dashboard — Today / Week / Month / Year / All time show
      correct totals and the chart uses the current data.
- [ ] Settings → Plan → **Turn off Pro (demo)** — dashboard button
      disappears, prompt card hides, goal pill hides, upgrade CTA returns.

**Session history**

- [ ] Complete two or three short sessions with different word counts.
- [ ] Click the clock icon in the popup — a "Recent sessions" panel
      opens with each session grouped under **Today**.
- [ ] Summary reads e.g. "1,247 words today · 3 sessions".
- [ ] Each row shows the start time, duration, and word count. When paste
      mode is "separate" and the session included pasted content, the
      row also shows `N typed · M pasted`.
- [ ] Click **Clear history** — the list empties.
- [ ] Zero-word sessions shorter than 1 second are not saved.

**Unsupported pages**

- [ ] Open `chrome://extensions` — no pill (expected, Chrome forbids
      content scripts there). Session remains active.
- [ ] Switch back to a supported tab — pill reappears.

**Multi-tab**

- [ ] Open two tabs on supported pages during a session — both show the
      same pill, same count. Typing in either tab updates both.

## Automated tests

Unit tests for the pure word-count engine and delta reducer live in
`tests/engine.test.js`.

```bash
cd extension
node tests/engine.test.js
```

Should print `25 passed, 0 failed`.

For a live visual test of the floating on-screen counter without loading
the full extension, serve the folder and open the preview page:

```bash
cd extension
python3 -m http.server 7777
# then visit http://127.0.0.1:7777/tests/preview.html
```

The preview shims `chrome.*` APIs so `content.js` runs in a normal tab.
Click **Start session** and type in the textarea to see the counter
appear, update, drag, and expand.

---

## Roadmap / adding future features

The Phase 1 code is deliberately structured so later phases plug in
cleanly:

- **Session history** — `background.js` already produces a fully-formed
  `lastResult` on every stop. Push it to a `sessions[]` array in
  `chrome.storage.local` to unlock daily/weekly/monthly aggregates.
- **User accounts & sync** — Wrap `getState` / `setState` with a storage
  adapter. `chrome.storage.local` today; add a cloud adapter (Firestore,
  Supabase, etc.) later without touching business logic.
- **Dashboard UI** — Add a new page under `dashboard/` and open it via
  `chrome.tabs.create` from a link in the popup.
- **Writing feedback** — Feed the `typedText` buffer (with explicit user
  consent) to an evaluator. The MVP already keeps writing content
  logically separate from writing statistics.
- **Subscription gate** — Add a `plan: 'free' | 'pro'` field to settings
  and gate advanced views on it.

No rewrite required — the popup, content script, and background are all
independent modules that talk over a well-defined message API.

### Suggestion mode verification

Backend regression tests (from `backend/`):

```sh
python -m pytest tests/test_suggestion_modes.py tests/test_suggestion_breadth.py tests/test_phase15_cost.py
```

The popup/browser regression uses the shipped popup and background code with
Chrome API and HTTP fixtures, so it runs without production credentials or
model calls. Install `tests/package.json` dependencies and Chromium with
Playwright, then run from the repository root:

```sh
node extension/tests/suggestion-modes.browser.cjs
```

`PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE` and `CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE` can point to existing installations.
This covers all three modes, alternatives, Save/reload, Expand input choices,
English/Spanish, Start/Stop, word counting, daily-cap errors and a narrow popup.
Live ingestion and model quality still require a configured Supabase/OpenAI
backend. The mode, questions and validated attribution are versioned in the
existing suggestion context column, with older records supported; no database
schema migration or client-side model key is required.

### UnoWord dashboard (0.11.0)

The popup has one navigation bar: Write, Ideas, Progress, Library. Write combines
completed typed words today with the current session (pasted text is excluded).
Calendar ranges and streaks respect the writing-profile timezone. Progress keeps
completed-session analytics; the standalone dashboard remains a wider page.
Library groups existing documents, websites, cloud/device memory, and saved ideas.

Website cards use full-width titles and an expandable action menu. Ready requires
stored text and a complete embedding index. Refresh repairs missing/partial
passages even when the page hash is unchanged. View extracted content reads a
bounded plain-text preview of the user's stored passages via
`GET /api/links/{id}/content`. No migration or new environment variable is needed.
Only public pages that can be fetched and extracted are supported; sign-in,
paywall and JavaScript-only pages may fail with an actionable status.

```sh
node --test extension/tests/*.test.js
node extension/tests/dashboard.browser.cjs
# Optional screenshots: set DASHBOARD_SCREENSHOTS to an output directory.
# Additional backend regressions, from backend/:
python -m pytest tests/test_link_library.py tests/test_source_availability.py tests/test_suggestion_breadth.py
```

The browser harness exercises the shipped popup/background against isolated
Chrome API and HTTP fixtures at 320/360/420 pixels in English and Spanish. It is
separate from live backend/model verification. Toolbar PNGs can be regenerated
from `icons/unoword.svg` with `python extension/icons/generate_icons.py` after
installing the developer-only `cairosvg` package.
